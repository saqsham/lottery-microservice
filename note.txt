Hi Shubham
You'll be working in the client dir
Currently it has some demo which is irrelevant to our project
You can delete all the contents from client folder and start from scratch 

And also you have to make the required webpages for admin, web-based only
make them in a separate folder eg: admin, on the root itself

Since you will not be working on server dir, there is no need to make branches
commit directly on master branch
